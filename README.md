# GroundTruth
an app letting you know if there are earthquakes or dangerous weather near you, and what you can do about it

##User flow:
* user lands on page. Are their earthquakes or dangerous weather nearby? (200miles)
* user can now enter a new location, if they want to see what dangerous weather is nearby.
* if there's nothing dangerous nearby, display a carasoul of dangerous weather survival tips



##Based on userâ€™s lat/long:
* what earthquakes are closest?
 * http://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/
 * http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/

* any dangerous weather bulletins?
 * http://forecast.io/
 * http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/
 * http://www.wunderground.com/?MR=1

##Users can contribute crowd-source data on shelters / supplies nearby
