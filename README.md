# GroundTruth
A quick demo AJAX project to visualize live earthquake data from [http://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)


###User flow:
* Person opens page from desktop or mobile, app will:
  * automatically locate them
  * center the map on their location and mark it
  * display nearby earthquakes from the last 24 hours

##### TODO:
- Currently using [gmaps.js](gmaps.js), switch to Googlemaps API directly
- Add overlay with more information about app
- Add options to switch USGS earthquake feed
- Add overlay with local earthquake resources in CA
